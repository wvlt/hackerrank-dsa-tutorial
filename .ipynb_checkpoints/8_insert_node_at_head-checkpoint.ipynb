    "# Insert a Node at the Head of a Linked List\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Master inserting nodes at the head (beginning) of a linked list - a simpler operation than tail insertion. This problem teaches you how to update the head pointer and properly link nodes at the beginning of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer `data`, create a new node with the given data and insert it at the head of the linked list. Return the new head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Head: `16 -> 13 -> NULL`, data: `15`\n",
    "- Result: `15 -> 16 -> 13 -> NULL`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand head insertion in linked lists\n",
    "- ✅ Master updating head pointers\n",
    "- ✅ Learn the difference between head and tail insertion\n",
    "- ✅ Handle edge cases (empty list)\n",
    "- ✅ Build on insertion fundamentals\n",

    "## 🔍 Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Insert 15 into `16 -> 13 -> NULL`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create new node:** `new_node` with data 15\n",
    "2. **Link to current head:** `new_node.next = llist` (points to 16)\n",
    "3. **Return new head:** Return `new_node` (15)\n",
    "4. **Result:** `15 -> 16 -> 13 -> NULL`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This works even if the list is empty (llist is None)!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(1) - Constant time! No traversal needed\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We only create one new node\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Tail Insertion:**\n",
    "- Head insertion: O(1) - Much faster!\n",
    "- Tail insertion: O(n) - Must traverse to end\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Head insertion is O(1):** No traversal needed, just pointer updates\n",
    "2. **Works with empty list:** `new_node.next = None` when list is empty\n",
    "3. **Return new head:** Always return the new node as the new head\n",
    "4. **Simpler than tail:** Head insertion is easier and faster than tail insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not returning new_node:** Must return the new node as the new head\n",
    "- **Wrong linking order:** Set `new_node.next = llist` BEFORE returning\n",
    "- **Forgetting to update head:** The caller must update their head pointer with the return value\n",
    "- **Confusing with tail insertion:** Head insertion is simpler - no traversal needed!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Practice Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare head vs tail insertion complexity\n",
    "- Practice with both empty and non-empty lists\n",
    "- Try implementing both insertions side by side\n",
    "- Think about when you'd prefer head vs tail insertion\n"
